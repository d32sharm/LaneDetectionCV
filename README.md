# LaneDetectionCV
Udacity self driving car nanodegree challenge problem

This project employs the use of opencv to detect lanes on the roads. A lane detection pipeline is developed using traditional 
computer vision techniques. The code is tested on the sample videos in test_videos directory and output is presented in the 
test_videos_output directory. The jupyter notebook P1.ipynb contains all the required code for the pipeline.
